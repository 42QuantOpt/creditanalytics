 * BasisSplineForwardRate manages the Discounting Latent State, using the Forward Rate as the State

 *  - Calculate discount factor / discount factor Jacobian
 *  - Calculate implied forward rate / implied forward rate Jacobian
 *  - Construct tweaked curve instances (parallel/tenor/custom tweaks)
 *  - Optionally provide the calibration instruments and quotes used to build the curve.
