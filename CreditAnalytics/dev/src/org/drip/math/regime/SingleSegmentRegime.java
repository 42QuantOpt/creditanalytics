/**
 * SingleSegmentRegime is the interface that exposes functionality that spans multiple segments. Its derived
 * 	instances hold the ordered segment sequence, the segment control parameters, and, if available, the
 * 	spanning Jacobian. SingleSegmentRegime exports the following group of functionality:
 * 	- Construct adjoining segment sequences in accordance with the segment control parameters
 * 	- Calibrate according to a varied set of (i.e., NATURAL/FINANCIAL) boundary conditions
 * 	- Estimate both the value, the ordered derivatives, and the Jacobian at the given ordinate
 * 	- Compute the monotonicity details - segment/regime level monotonicity, co-monotonicity, local
 * 		monotonicity.
 * 
 * It also exports several static regime creation/calibration methods to generate customized basis splines,
 * 	with customized segment behavior using the segment control.
