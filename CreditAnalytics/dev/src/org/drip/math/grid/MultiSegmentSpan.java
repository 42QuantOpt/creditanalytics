/**
 * Span is the interface that exposes functionality that spans multiple segments. Its derived instances hold
 * 	the ordered segment sequence, the segment control parameters, and, if available, the spanning Jacobian.
 *  Span exports the following group of functionality:
 * 	- Construct adjoining segment sequences in accordance with the segment control parameters
 * 	- Calibrate according to a varied set of (i.e., NATURAL/FINANCIAL) boundary conditions
 * 	- Interpolate both the value, the ordered derivatives, and the Jacobian at the given ordinate
 * 	- Compute the monotonicity details - segment/span level monotonicity, co-monotonicity, local
 * 		monotonicity.
 * 
 * It also exports several static Span creation/calibration methods to generate customized basis splines,
 * 	with customized segment behavior using the segment control.
